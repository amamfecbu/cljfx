# How to Download Axt Arabic Fonts for QuarkXPress
 
If you want to use Arabic fonts in QuarkXPress, you need to install AXt fonts and Layout Ltd's ArabicXT extension. AXt fonts are non-Unicode fonts that use the Mac Roman encoding, which means that Arabic glyphs are substituted for the Roman glyphs. For example, 'alef' replaces capital letter G. The AXt fonts are designed to work only with ArabicXT, and can contain features such as ligatures, contextual forms, and diacritics[^1^].

ArabicXT is an extension for QuarkXPress that enables you to type and edit Arabic text in QuarkXPress. ArabicXT also provides you with tools and options to control the appearance and behavior of Arabic text, such as alignment, justification, kerning, hyphenation, and more. ArabicXT supports various Arabic fonts, including AXt fonts.
 
AXt fonts are a special type of Arabic fonts that use the Mac Roman encoding instead of the Unicode encoding. This means that they replace the Roman characters with Arabic characters in the font file. For example, the letter G becomes 'alef' in AXt fonts. This way, you can type Arabic text using the Roman keyboard layout in QuarkXPress. However, you need to have ArabicXT installed to use AXt fonts correctly.
 
AXt fonts are popular among Arabic users of QuarkXPress because they offer a wide range of styles and features that are suitable for different types of documents and designs. Some of the most common AXt fonts are AXtManalBold Regular, AXtShareQ Regular, and AXtSahar Regular. You can download these and other AXt fonts from various websites that offer free Arabic fonts.
